As I decided to switch from Java to Python mid way through the assignment, tasks 1 and 2 have been split from tasks 3, 4 and 5

- Files pertaining to task 1 and 2 are stored in java com.amazonaws.samples
- All other code files are contained within Back-End, all html files are contained within templates and the python code is all inside main.py
